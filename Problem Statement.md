# Expense Tracker CRM

## Problem Statement

Organizations and individuals often struggle to monitor and control their expenses effectively. Traditional methods, such as spreadsheets or generic budgeting apps, do not provide real-time insights, personalized alerts, or collaborative approval workflows. This leads to overspending, delayed expense approvals, and poor financial visibility. A CRM solution is needed that integrates expense logging, budget tracking, and reporting in a single platform for better financial management.
